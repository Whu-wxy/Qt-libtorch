# Qt-libtorch
Qt+libtorch+opencvï¼Œimage classifier
1.QtTorch uses CMakelist.txt to config, you need to be familiar with CMakelist.txt.
2.QtTorchPro uses qmake and pro to config, it's very easy to use. I recommend using this.


# my environment:

Qt5.12, linux-libtorch(1.3), opencv3.4.2



# Note: 

1.Export the model file by pytorch_export.py first

2.Modify file path in main.cpp
